              SQL databases are table based, but NoSQL databases are mostly object or key-value based. So SQL is better for structured data like tables. While NoSQL databases are better for unstructured data like JSON. Also, SQL databases are vertically scalable but NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

              JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It helps to encrypt the user data so that the data does not fall into the wrong hands. Also, it issues a token for authentication, which can be decrypted and used for authentication purposes. The token can be stored on local storage but it is not recommended. it is mostly stored on http only cookie. this token can be sent with API and then decoded to authenticate the user.

              JavaScript is a simple scripting language which is used for creating interactive web pages. While node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment. Usually JavaScript can run only in the browser. but with node.js, now javascript code can be executed outside of the browser as well. JavaScript is used for frontend web development while Node.js is used for backend web development in the server side.

              Node JS handle multiple request at the same time by one of it's main features, event loop. Event loop allows Node JS to run asynchronous functions. As it is normally single threaded, it handles one request at a time. but for asynchronous functions, it sets that asynchronous function aside from the call stack, and starts working on the next requests. This method allows node to do multiple tasks at the same time even though it is single threaded.
